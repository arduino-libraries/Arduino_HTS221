# ArduinoHTS221 library


The ArduinoHTS221 library allows you to use the HTS221 sensor available on the Arduino&reg; Nano 33 BLE Sense board to read the temperature and the relative humidity of the environment.

To use this library:

```
#include <Arduino_HTS221.h>
```

Main features of the HTS221 sensor:

- Humidity accuracy: ± 3.5% rH, 20 to +80% rH.
- Humidity range: 0 to 100%.
- Temperature accuracy: ± 0.5 °C, 15 to +40 °C.
- Temperature range: -40 to 120° C,
